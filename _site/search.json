More particularly, the evaluation will centre around the seven-day moving average of tests performed per confirmed COVID19 case."

    "text": "Data Description\nThe numerical data used for this analysis have been downloaded from the “Our World in Data” dataset that contains COVID-19 data for nearly every country in the world. This dataset holds daily COVID-19 testing statistics namely:\nThe key variables include: - Day: The recording that indicates the day the data was registered. - Entity: Where the information was gathered Within the four countries: India, Israel, United Kingdom, Brazil. - Tests per Confirmed Case: The turn out of COVID-19 tests to each confirmed case.\nThe collected data in the current study underwent some data cleaning procedures to enhance their analysis. This included: - Filtering out data for only the four selected countries: India, Israel, United Kingdom and Brazil. Day reformatted as date. To make the trends more manageable, both the tests and the confirmed cases are averaged for a 7-day rolling rate.\n\n# Loading necessary libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.0     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(zoo)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'zoo'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.Date, as.Date.numeric\n\n# Loading the data\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/risha/Downloads/covid (1).csv\")\n\n# Filtering the data for selected countries\nselected_countries &lt;- c(\"India\", \"United Kingdom\", \"Brazil\", \"Israel\")\nfiltered_data &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(Entity %in% selected_countries)\n\n# Converting 'Day' to Date type\nfiltered_data$Day &lt;- as.Date(filtered_data$Day)\n\n# Calculating 7-day rolling average with the correct column name\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Entity) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Day) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Rolling_Avg = rollmean(Daily.COVID.19.tests.per.new.confirmed.case, k = 7, fill = NA, align = \"right\"))"
