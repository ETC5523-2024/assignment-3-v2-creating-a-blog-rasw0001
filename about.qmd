Hello! My name is Rishab Aswani, and I am a Business Analytics student with a focus on making informed decisions based on data analysis. This blog, part of my "Communicating with Data" unit, covers a range of topics, starting with COVID-19 testing strategies. My goal is to use data to uncover trends and provide actionable insights.
